Disclaimer
Production Readiness and Model Quality: The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate a viable technical pipeline for model conversion, specifically from a JIT-compiled PyTorch model to a TFLite format for integration with Android using AI Edge Gallery and other platforms like Ollama/Gemma3N on an offline laptop. This model is not production-ready. It has not been subjected to rigorous performance, accuracy, or bias testing. The code serves as a proof-of-concept for the conversion process, and any further development would require extensive model improvement and validation before real-world deployment.

Not a Medical Tool; No Medical Advice: The output from this model, whether used in an Android app or integrated with an LLM like Gemma3N, is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. This model is an experimental tool for pattern recognition and should never be used as a replacement for consulting a qualified healthcare professional.
